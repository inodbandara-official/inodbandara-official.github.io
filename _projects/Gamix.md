# Gamix Web Project

Gamix Web is like a mini e-commerce marketplace, except it's not a big-name store—it's just a project I built to showcase a full-stack setup! It includes buyer and seller dashboards, product pages, login/signup flows, and more—all pieced together with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and a dash of Hack. Think of it as a pretend online shopping site, made to show off how everything fits together neatly.
